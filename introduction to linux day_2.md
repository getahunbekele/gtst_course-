                                           Introduction  to  linux 

 What is linux ?
 
    ● Linux is a kernel.

    ● Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). 
      An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, 
      like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware 
      and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
    ● Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds 
      to create a new free operating system kernel. 
      The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. 
      Since the initial release of its source code in 1991,
      it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution 
      to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments,
      under the GNU General Public License v2.

 What is kernel ?

    ● Kernel is a code/program that used to meet your Software and Hardware. 
      And allocate some resources.

    ● kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally 
      has complete control over everything in the system.  
      It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates 
      interactions between hardware and software components. 
      A full kernel controls all hardware resources (e.g. I/O, memory, cryptography) via device drivers, arbitrates conflicts 
      between processes concerning such resources, and optimizes the utilization of common resources
      e.g. CPU & cache usage, file systems, and network sockets. On most systems, 
      the kernel is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). 
      It handles the rest of startup as well as memory, peripherals, and input/output (I/O) 
      requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for 
      the central processing unit.
                                        History of linux

  
   ● In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie 
     created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,

   ● Richard Stallman announced the GNU Linux project in 1983 and cofounded 
     the Free Software Foundation in 1985.

   ● GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIXOS, 
     But it was just software replacement not fullos {examples: Bash,tar,emacs…}

   ● So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.

   ● The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system  
     created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed


 what os shell ?
   
   ● Users communicate with the kernel by the shell.

   ● The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user 
     and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel
  
 types of shell 
   
   ● Based on their features there are money shells.

    SH
    BASH
    ZSH
    FISH

   They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation, some kind of features.

 What is OS- Operating system ?
   
   ● An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, 
     and provides common services for computer programs.

   ● We have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS but what is OS. 
     OS is “operating system”, which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on.

   ● It contains:

       . Kernel
       . Softwares
       . Desktop environment
       . File extensions
       . Window manager

 Types of desktop environment on linux 
    
    1 mate
    2 gnome
    3 KDE plasma
    4 XFCE 

 Why Linux?
   . fast
   . every where finded
   . most hacking tools
   . most secured

 Linux distributions/distro

   ● Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different
 
 types pf destro
 
   ● Debian          
     . Kali linux
     . Ubuntu
     . Parrot
   
   ● Arch
     . Black 
     . arch
     . Garuda

   ● Fedora
   ● Red Hat
   ● Gentoo
   ● Android

 Which is best for hackers?
   
   ● Kali linux
   ● Parrot Os
   ● Garuda
   ● Black Arch

 Kali linux
   ● Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for
     digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and
     funded by Offensive Security.

   . Desktop Env: xfce
   . Package manager: apt
   . Shell: zsh

 Parrot Os
   ● Parrot OS is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a focus on security, privacy, and development.

   . Desktop Env: mate
   . Package manager: apt
   . shell: bash
  
 Garuda
   ● Garuda Linux is a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operatingsystem.

   . Desktop Env: KDE plasma
   . Package Manager: pacman
   . shell: fish
     
 Do windows have distros?

  ● Windows is not open-source so peoples won’t use / edit it, so there won’t be other kind.
  ● It just give updates and adds some feature on it.
 

 How can we use it ?  
  
   ● Main OS/ Main-boot
   ● DualBoot / 2in1
   ● Live boot
   ● Cloud terminals
   ● Virtual Machine
   ● WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux
   ● Termux - Android
